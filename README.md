This is my first HTML project for Odin. This basic website will consist of an index page and
three recipe pages that will be linked to it. I have learned a bit about using git
and github, letting me go back to previous snapshots and load from there. I have also learned
about uploading images and resizing them to fit how I would like them to. I feel I have a good 
handle on lists, links, text, images, tags, and have become proficient in writing the boilerplate 
for my HTML files. Most of all I have enjoyed practicing what I have learned in my HTML lessons
and using my own recipes for this project!
Hope you enjoy!
