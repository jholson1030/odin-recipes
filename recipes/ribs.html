        <p>If you like American Barbecue then you'll fall in love with these ribs. For best results try to use
            baby back or loin back ribs. Also, the cooking times are very important and can mean the difference between
            perfect, fall off the bone ribs and mushy pulled pork that you have to eat with a fork. Lastly, you can use 
            any store bought barbecue sauce that you like, however the brown KC style sauces caramelize and thicken better
            while baking. The same goes for the rib rub, just make sure it is brown sugar based.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One rack of baby back or loin back ribs roughly 3 pounds.</li>
            <li>One cup of brown sugar based rib rub.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
            <li>14-16 ounces of Kansas City style barbecue sauce <em>For best results use homemade</em></li>
            <li>Large sheet pan that will fit the rack of ribs</li>
            <li>Kitchen grade sauce brush</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Remove raw ribs from the packaging and briefly rinse under cold water then pat dry.</li>
            <li>Line your sheet pan with aluminum foil. Then, put down another sheet of foil twice as long as the rack of ribs.</li>
            <em>For better cooking have the shinier side of the foil facing upwards</em>
            <li>Place the ribs on the longer sheet of foil and completely coat with the spice rub. You want to completely cover them.</li>
            <li>Wrap the rack of ribs in the longer sheet of foil very tightly. You want to let as little steam escape as possible.</li>
            <li>Put the sheet pan with the wrapped ribs in the preheated oven and let it bake for approximately two and a half hours.</li>
