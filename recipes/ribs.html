        <p>If you like American Barbecue then you'll fall in love with these ribs. For best results try to use
            baby back or loin back ribs. Also, the cooking times are very important and can mean the difference between
            perfect, fall off the bone ribs and mushy pulled pork that you have to eat with a fork. Lastly, you can use 
            any store bought barbecue sauce that you like, however the brown KC style sauces caramelize and thicken better
            while baking. The same goes for the rib rub, just make sure it is brown sugar based.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One rack of baby back or loin back ribs roughly 3 pounds.</li>
            <li>One cup of brown sugar based rib rub.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
            <li>14-16 ounces of Kansas City style barbecue sauce <em>For best results use homemade</em></li>
            <li>Large sheet pan that will fit the rack of ribs</li>
            <li>Kitchen grade sauce brush</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Remove raw ribs from the packaging and briefly rinse under cold water then pat dry.</li>
            <li>Line your sheet pan with aluminum foil. Then, put down another sheet of foil twice as long as the rack of ribs.</li>
            <em>For better cooking have the shiny side of the foil facing upwards</em>
            <li>Place the ribs on the longer sheet of foil and completely coat with the spice rub. You want to completely cover them.</li>
            <li>Wrap the rack of ribs in the longer sheet of foil very tightly. You want to let as little steam escape as possible.</li>
            <li>Put the sheet pan with the wrapped ribs in the preheated oven and let it bake for approximately two and a half hours.</li>
            <em>If you are making your own homemade sauce now would be the perfect time!</em>
            <li>When the two and a half hours is up take the ribs out of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>Peel away the foil covering the ribs.</li>
            <li>Add a generous amount of barbecue sauce to cover the ribs.</li>
            <li>Put the uncovered, sauced ribs back in the oven for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the ribs out and brush with the remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Put them back in the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let your ribs rest on the counter for 20 minutes. Afterwards you should be ready to cut and serve!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If done right you should have moist, sticky ribs that barely cling to the bone!</p>
