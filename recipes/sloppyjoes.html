        <h1>Savory and Spicy Homemade Sloppy Joes</h1>

            <!--Photo of sloppy joes goes here-->

        <p>Sloppy Joes were always a personal favorite of mine partly because they are so versatile. Not
            only can you just eat them as a cheap, filling meal, you can use the leftover meat for nachos, baked potatoes,
            as a filling for puff pastries, a casserole, the list goes on. Maybe feeling tired of traditional sloppy joes?
            Substitute soy sauce for worcestershire and add some ground ginger and Chinese five spice to give it an Asian zing! This
            is a very difficult recipe to mess up so its perfect if you don't have a lot of cooking experience and just want a quick, 30 minutes
            meal using some ground beef and some ingredients laying around your pantry! This recipe will just be for sandwiches though but if 
            you're feeling spicy you can get creative ;)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One pound of ground beef. 85/15 is fine but you don't want any more fat then that. It will all
                be drained out anyway.</li>
            <li>One cup of ketchup</li>
            <li>A quarter cup of yellow mustard.</li>
            <li>A quarter cup of barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons of hot sauce. Tabasco is fine but I prefer sriracha.</li> 
            <li>One tablespoon of worcestershire sauce</li> 
            <li>One tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>Two teaspoons of black pepper</li>
            <li>Two teaspoons of granulated garlic</li>  
            <li>One teaspoon of paprika</li>
            <li>One teaspoon of crushed red pepper</li>
        </ul>
