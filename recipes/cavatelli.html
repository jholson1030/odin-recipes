        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An Italian baked pasta dish with a combination of red and white sauce and lots of cheese! Any
            kind of pasta will work, but for this recipe I will use Ziti. Also fresh basil is recommended
            for extra flavor. Best served with fresh bread or breadsticks!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One 16 ounce package of dried Ziti</li>
            <li>Two pounds of raw Italian sausage</li>
            <li>One jar of marinara sauce</li>
            <li>One jar of alfredo or bechamel sauce</li>
            <li>Roughly 10 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>One package of shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
            <li>Three ounces of fresh basil(Chopped)</li>
            <li>Three cloves of garlic (Minced)</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons of your favorite Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Brown the italian sausage in a skillet and reduce heat to low until fully cooked. Drain the excess fat and set aside.</li>

            <li>When water has boiled add the ziti and stir. Continue stirring every few minutes until the pasta is al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta in a colander and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside for later.</li>
            <li>In a large pot combine the pasta, italian sausage, garlic, red and white sauces, seasonings and stir until the sauces turn to a pinkish color.</li>
            <li>Add the ricotta breaking it up into marble sized pieces and top with the shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Put into the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes until cheese has browned.</li>
